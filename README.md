# Collision Detection System

<p align="justify">

This project implements a **collision detection and warning system** based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.  
The system measures distances using ultrasonic sensors, evaluates potential collision risks, and issues alerts via LEDs and a buzzer.  
Additionally, all processed data is transmitted over the **CAN bus** using an MCP2551 transceiver for integration with other automotive systems.

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage
1. Assemble the hardware according to the provided schematic and PCB layout.
2. Connect the **ST-Link** programmer to flash the firmware into STM32.
3. Power the system with 5V (regulated).
4. Place obstacles within **2.5 – 3.5 m** to test collision detection.
5. Observe LED and buzzer activation, and verify CAN messages using a **CAN analyzer**.

Note: in /lib has a small library file for can bus. let you to download and import that file into code
